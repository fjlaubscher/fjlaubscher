# Hi! I'm Francois. <br /> I :heart: building for the web.

I'm a Senior Full-stack Engineer at [Toptal](https://toptal.com) with 12 years of experience building and maintaining robust web applications.

Throughout my career, I've contributed to projects across a wide spectrum of environments—from structured enterprises to high-velocity startups and agencies—crafting solutions that streamline operations and elevate user experiences.
My technical focus centers on modern web technologies, especially `TypeScript`, `React` and `Node.js`.

With over 6 years of remote work experience, I thrive in distributed teams and bring a reliable, self-directed work ethic to every project.
